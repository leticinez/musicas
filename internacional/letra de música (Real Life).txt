1. Real Life - Imagine Dragons

She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Every single time

And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

So I said, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live, yeah, real life, real life?"

Prays on her knees as the towers fold
To a God she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs blow (ooh)
She said, "How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?"
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I thank you for the day when everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop

So I said, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live, yeah, real life, real life?"

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold too
Only thing that's real to me is
You

"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live that real life, real life?"
Oh, hey, "Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes
Can we live, yeah, real life, real life?"

Oh, hey (real life, hey)
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
